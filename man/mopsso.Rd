}
\arguments{
\item{tasks}{List. Task definitions including priorities, activities,
and precedence constraints.}

\item{self_resource}{List. In-house resource definitions.}

\item{outsourced_resource}{List. Outsourced resource definitions.}

\item{resource_windows}{List. Resource availability time windows.}

\item{resource_joint_cost}{List. Joint cost between resources.}

\item{resource_mapping}{List. Mapping between in-house and outsourced resources.}

\item{pop_size}{Integer. Number of particles in the swarm.}

\item{max_gen}{Integer. Maximum number of generations.}

\item{max_archive_size}{Integer. Maximum size of the external archive.}
}
\value{
A list of particles representing the Pareto front. Each particle contains
its position, fitness vector, and decoded schedule.
}
\description{
This function implements a multi-objective particle swarm optimization
(MOPSO) algorithm for task scheduling. It initializes a particle swarm,
iteratively updates particles, maintains an external archive of
non-dominated solutions, and returns the final Pareto front.
